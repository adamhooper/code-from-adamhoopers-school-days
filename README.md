Old School Code
===============

This repository contains code I wrote while studying for a Bachelor of Software
Engineering at McGill University. (I graduated December 2006.) I wrote some
projects for school assignments and other projects for personal enrichment.

I once hosted this code on [my personal website](http://adamhooper.com) for
almost a decade. Finally I decided I should really be placing it with all my
more recent code.

This stuff is old and unmaintained. You may find some interesting tricks
hidden within in Python, C, C++, Scheme or Java.
